XML is piece of crap.
JSON is reasonable choice for sparse data.
Map-Reduce is not right architecture for broad scale. Turning into HDFS.

In OLTP, main-memory SQL engines with lightweight transaction management are becoming the norm.
Basic architecture: parsing/optimizer/executor.
Summary: Last decade, mostly reinvent wheel.
