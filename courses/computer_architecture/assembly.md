# high-level FSM
#card
each state are more than simple logic levels

# byte addresses
#card
memory addresses are byte addressed.
e.g. instructions are 32-bit words, consecutive instruction addresses differ by 4.

# 32/64bit architecture
#card
32/64 bit registers and 32/64 bit datapath

# type of instructions
#card
ALU, Load & Store, Branch


# assembler
#card
reads text file of asm program and produce 32-bit words to be loaded into memory

# UASM
microassembler
