**Background:  [http://cpetry.github.io/TextureGenerator-Online/](http://cpetry.github.io/TextureGenerator-Online/)**

**Blender: 3D modeling software**

**    **

**Lua:**



*   . vs : - The colon is for implementing methods that pass self as the first parameter. So x:bar(3,4)should be the same as x.bar(x,3,4).
*   Object methods - self:method
*   Object attributes - self.attr

**Hitbox Detection**



*   Rectangle
*   Reset position when doing AABB (axis-aligned bounding boxes) collision

**Parallax Scrolling**



*   Scrolling with the illusion of movement. E.g. Mountain & Fence while driving on freeway

**Image Looping**



*   Image size at least twice the screen widths to achieve infinite background

** Forgiving & Fun**



*   Relaxed hitbox detection

**Sound Collision**



*   Common in sound design?

**Sprite sheets**



*   Use rectangle to draw subset of a big image of sprites
*   love.graphics.newQuad()
*   love.graphics.draw(texture, quad, x, y)

**Particle System**



*   E.g. fire
*   love.graphics.newParticleSystem

**File Access**



*   love.filesystem.setIdentity
*   love.fiesystem.exists
*   love.filesystem.write
*   Love.filesystem.lines

**Timer Library**



*   Timer.every(interval, callback)
*   Timer.after(interval, callback)
*   Timer.tween(duration, definition)
    *   E.g. Timer.tween(bird.rate, {[bird] = { x = endX, opacity = 255}})
*   Timer.finish(callback)

**Knife Modules**

● knife.behavior (state machines) 

● knife.bind (bind arguments to functions) 

● knife.chain (flatten asynchronous code) 

● knife.convoke (flatten coroutine-based async code) 

● knife.event (dispatch and handle events) 

● knife.memoize (for memoization) 

● Knife.serialize (stores data structures as strings) 

● knife.system (an entity-component system) 

● knife.test (testing framework) 

● knife.timer (timers and tweens) 

**Palette**

Stick with 16,32 colors to get good style and retro

**Palette swapping**

E.g. OW skins.

**Tilemaps**



*   Level is comprised of many small tiles that give the appearance of some larger whole.
*   Tiles often have id of some kind to differentiate their appearance or behavior

**Camera Shifting**

love.graphics.translate(x, y)

**Animations**

Can be achieved by simply displaying a series of frames from a sprite sheet one after the other, akin to a flip book.

**Procedural Level Generation **

● Platformer levels can be procedurally generated like anything else 

● These levels can be easily generated per column rather than per row, given things like gaps, though there are multiple ways to do it 

● Most easily, tiles can foundationally be generated and act as the condition upon which GameObjects and Entities are generated

**Tile Collision**

● AABB can be useful for detecting entities, but we can take advantage of our static coordinate system and 2D tile array and just calculate whether the pixels in the direction we’re traveling are solid, saving us computing time. 

● See `TileMap:pointToTile(x, y)`! 

● Can just directly check tiles on the map once coordinates are converted by dividing them by TILE_SIZE 

● Notably better than having to iterate over all tiles to check AABB in terms of performance, with some inflexibilities (tiles can’t move around, for example)

**Entities, composition over inheritance**

● Can contain states just like the game, with their own StateMachine; states can affect input handling (for the player) or decision-making (like the Snail) 

● Some engines may adopt an Entity-Component System (or ECS), where everything is an Entity and Entities are simply containers of Components, and Components ultimately drive behavior (Unity revolves around an ECS) 

● Collision can just be done entity-to-entity using AABB collision detection 

● Represent the living things in our distro (Snail and Player), but could represent most anything; arbitrary

**Game Objects**

● Separate from the tiles in our map, for things that maybe don’t align perfectly with it (maybe they have different widths/heights or their positions are offset by a different amount than TILE_SIZE) 

● Can be tested for collision by AABB 

● Often just containers of traits and functions 

● Could be represented via Entities, but aren’t in this distro

**Powerups** 

● Effectively a GameObject that changes some “status” or trait of the player ● An invincible star may flip an “invincible” flag on the player and begin an “invincibleDuration” timer ● A mushroom to grow the player may trigger a “huge” flag on the player that alters their x, y, width, and height and then scales their sprite

**Event library: functions **

● Event.on(name, callback) 

  ○ Calls `callback`, which is a function, whenever the message by its `name` is dispatched via `Event.dispatch`. 

● Event.dispatch(name, [params]) 

   ○ Calls the callback function registered to `name`, set by `Event.on`, with some optional `params` that will be sent to that callback function as arguments. 

**Stenciling functions **

useful for layouts, e.g. walking through a door



*   love.graphics.stencil
*   love.graphics.setStencilTest


# Box2D

Physics engine (not only love2d)

● https://love2d.org/wiki/love.physics 

● https://love2d.org/wiki/Tutorial:Physics 

● [http://www.iforce2d.net/b2dtut/introduction](http://www.iforce2d.net/b2dtut/introduction)

**The World **

● Performs all physics calculations on all "Bodies" it holds a reference to. 

● Possesses a gravity value that affects every Body in the scene in addition to each Body's own characteristics.

● love.physics.newWorld(gravX, gravY, [sleep]) 

○ Creates a new World object to simulate physics, as provided by Box2D, with gravX and gravY for global gravity and an optional sleep parameter to allow non-moving Bodies in our world to sleep (to not have their physics calculated when they're completely still, for performance gains).

**Bodies **

● Abstract containers that manage position and velocity. 

● Can be manipulated via forces (or just raw positional assignment) to bring about physical behavior when updated by the World.

● love.physics.newBody(world, x, y, type) 

○ Creates a new Body in our world at x and y, with type being what kind of physical body it is ('static', 'dynamic', or 'kinematic', which we'll explore).


    ● Static: Cannot be moved as by applying force, but can influence other dynamic bodies. 


    ● Dynamic: A "normal" body that can move around and interact with other bodies, closest to real life. 


    ● Kinematic: Can move but not influenced by the interaction of other bodies; an abstract type of body that's suitable for certain environmental pieces (like indefinitely rotating platforms that defy gravity).

**Fixtures **

● The individual components of Bodies that possess physical characteristics to influence Bodies' movements. 

● Attach shapes to Bodies, influencing collision. 

● Have densities, frictional characteristics, restitution (bounciness), and more.

● love.physics.newFixture(body, shape) 

  ○ Creates a new Fixture for a given body, attaching the shape to it relative to the center, influencing it for the World's collision detection.

**Shapes**

● love.physics.newCircleShape(radius) 

● love.physics.newRectangleShape(width, height) 

● love.physics.newEdgeShape(x, y, width, height) 

● love.physics.newChainShape(loop, x1, y1, x2…)

 ● love.physics.newPolygonShape(x1, y1, x2, y2…)

**Mouse Input, Important Functions**

● love.mousepressed(x, y, key) 

○ Callback that executes whenever the user clicks a mouse button; has access to the X and Y of the mouse press, as well as the particular "key" (or mouse button). 

● love.mousereleased(x, y, key) 

○ The opposite of love.mousepressed, which is fired whenever we release a mouse key in our scene; also takes in the coordinates of the release and the key that was released.

**Collison Callbacks **

● The World fires four different functions for each collision between any two fixtures: beginContact, endContact, preSolve, and postSolve. 

● Defining these callbacks allows you to program what happens at any given stage of any collision, beyond just objects bouncing off each other. 

● [https://love2d.org/wiki/Tuto](https://love2d.org/wiki/Tuto)

● World:setCallbacks(f1, f2, f3, f4) 

● f1 (beginContact); fired when a collision begins ● f2 (endContact); fired when a collision ends ● f3 (preSolve); fired before a collision resolves ● f4 (postSolve); fired after a collision resolves, with resolve data

**StateStack**

Basically states with stack of parent states

● Allows us to return back to states as they were when we left them, rather than create new ones. 

● Can allow us to render multiple states at once. 

● Only the top-most state on the stack is being updated at once, though this could be changed if we wanted it to.

GUIs 

● Short for "graphical user interface" 

● Common widgets and elements include Panels, Labels, Textboxes, Scrollbars, and others


# Unity

**GameObjects **

● The core class in Unity; everything is a GameObject. 

● GameObjects are comprised of MonoBehaviours, which are effectively components in an Entity-Component System (ECS). 

● MonoBehaviours are programmed in C# and give GameObjects their behavior by operating in tandem.
